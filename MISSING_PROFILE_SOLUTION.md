# Missing Profile Solution

## Problem Description

When users sign in with Google OAuth through the "Log In" flow instead of "Sign Up", they get created in the auth table but not in the profiles table. This causes the following errors:

1. `"JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned"` when trying to fetch profile data
2. Console errors in various components trying to access non-existent profile data
3. Broken user experience when trying to use features that require profile information

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because:
1. Google OAuth creates users in the `auth.users` table
2. The `AuthCallback` component only handles the "Sign Up" flow properly
3. When users use "Log In" with Google OAuth, no profile is created
4. Components try to fetch profile data and fail with PGRST116 errors

## Solution Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Detects missing profiles** using a custom hook (`useMissingProfile`)
2. **Shows a profile setup modal** when users are authenticated but lack profiles
3. **Handles errors gracefully** in all components that fetch profile data
4. **Provides a smooth user experience** for completing profile setup

## Components Added/Modified

### New Components

1. **`MissingProfileModal.js`** - Modal that appears when users need to complete profile setup
2. **`useMissingProfile.js`** - Custom hook to detect missing profiles

### Modified Components

1. **`App.js`** - Integrated missing profile detection and modal
2. **`UserTypeSelectionModal.js`** - Added callback support for profile creation
3. **`Navbar.js`** - Graceful error handling for missing profiles
4. **`IndividualDashboard.js`** - Better error handling for missing profiles
5. **`MessagingView.js`** - Graceful handling of missing profile data
6. **`ChatInterface.js`** - Better error handling for profile detection

## How It Works

### 1. Detection
The `useMissingProfile` hook checks if a user is authenticated but doesn't have a profile in the `profiles` table.

### 2. Modal Display
When a missing profile is detected, the `MissingProfileModal` appears, which:
- Shows a user-friendly message
- Opens the `UserTypeSelectionModal` for profile setup
- Handles the profile creation process

### 3. Profile Creation
The `UserTypeSelectionModal` creates the necessary profile records:
- `profiles` table entry
- `individual_profiles` or `business_profiles` table entry (or both)

### 4. Error Handling
All components now handle PGRST116 errors gracefully:
- Log informative messages instead of errors
- Show appropriate fallback UI
- Don't break the user experience

## Testing the Solution

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a test user with missing profile:**
   ```sql
   -- Sign in with Google OAuth through "Log In" flow
   -- This will create a user in auth.users but not in profiles
   ```

2. **Verify the modal appears:**
   - The `MissingProfileModal` should appear automatically
   - User should be able to complete profile setup
   - After setup, the modal should close and page should refresh

3. **Test error handling:**
   - Check console for informative log messages instead of errors
   - Verify components don't crash when profile data is missing

### Automated Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-missing-profile.js
```

This will verify that:
- Missing profile detection works correctly
- Error handling is working as expected
- The solution handles the exact scenario described

## Error Codes Handled

- **PGRST116**: "No rows returned" - This is the main error we handle
- Other database errors are still logged for debugging

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Log In" with Google OAuth
2. Google OAuth creates user in auth table only
3. App detects missing profile via `useMissingProfile` hook
4. `MissingProfileModal` appears with setup instructions
5. User completes profile setup via `UserTypeSelectionModal`
6. Profile records are created in database
7. Modal closes and page refreshes
8. User can now use all features normally

## Benefits

1. **Industry Standard Handling**: Follows best practices for incomplete user profiles
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Components don't crash when profile data is missing
3. **User-Friendly**: Clear messaging and easy profile completion
4. **Comprehensive**: Handles all components that might encounter missing profiles
5. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns with custom hooks

## Future Improvements

1. **Analytics**: Track how often this scenario occurs
2. **A/B Testing**: Test different messaging approaches
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Allow partial feature access while profile is incomplete
4. **Email Reminders**: Send follow-up emails for users who don't complete setup
