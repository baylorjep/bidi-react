// this is where you will build in the component for the portfolio page

//1. Update BidDisplay.js (the component used to display a bid to users)(it's in the components/Bid directory ) 
// so that when users click the business name, they are taken to the business's portfolio page.

//2. Finish creating this component:  Portfolio.js,
// start with a basic view  that will show the portfolio page from a given business

//3. Update App.js (in the src directory) to handle the routing for the portfolio page.
// my guess is the best way to do this is by grabbing the associated business ID from the bid and passing it to the portfolio page
