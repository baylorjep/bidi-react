            <p>Weddings are some of the most special days of a person’s life, both for the engaged couple and their loved ones. But all of the pain that goes into planning the wedding can make the whole day feel more like a performance than a celebration.</p>
            <h2>Marriage, Weddings, and History</h2>
            <p>Marriage as an institution has been a part of human society for over 4,000 years (The Week). For most of its history, marriage has been a matter of practicality, at least for men, as their wives’ identities and property became absorbed into their own. Dowries, or money paid by the bride’s family to the groom, were popular in the West starting in the Middle Ages as a way to help the couple start a new household, or in some cases, entice men to marry an otherwise unappealing bride, and dowries continue to be popular in some cultures to this day (Britannica).</p>
            <p>For most of us living in the twenty-first century, marriages are no longer merely economic propositions, especially since women can now vote, take out credit cards, and are given equal opportunity to divorce. However, weddings are a whole different beast.</p>
            <p>Marriages have been celebrated for as long as they have existed in a variety of ways; the union between two individuals has often represented larger unions between families, communities, and sometimes even countries. Wedding celebrations were a chance for the families of the bride and groom to show off their collective wealth by providing feasts and merriment for their guests. Most of us nowadays aren’t nobility, but it can feel like we should be when it comes to planning a wedding. The wedding industry has gotten out of control in the past several decades, and what should be a celebration of unity and community has become a stressful, day-long payoff of months (sometimes years!) of planning and tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
            <p>I love weddings as much as the next person. I think it’s beautiful that humans from all different walks of life come together to support the people they love as they embark on a massive change in life. But I have no desire to make planning a wedding my second job for a whole year, nor do I want to have to get a second job just to pay for one.</p>

            <h2>The Financial Costs</h2>
            <p>According to wedding planning service The Knot, the average 2025 wedding cost is $33,000, or about $284 per guest. As a frugal college student who pays blessedly little in tuition, I live on less than $33,000 a year. For that amount, I could put a down payment on a house, or buy a new (or in this economy, gently used) car. Even for people who can afford to fork over that amount of cash, is it really worth it for what often amounts to a single, stressful day? I have lots of people in my life that I love, but I have very few people that I love enough to want to spend $284 for them to attend a party where they get a decent meal, some bubbles, and some Instagram-worthy photos.</p>
            <p>And this $33,000 statistic doesn’t necessarily include the costs paid by your guests themselves. The high cost of weddings doesn’t just affect the bride and groom; it can put a damper on the rest of the wedding party as well. There are countless forum posts on places like Wedding Wire and Reddit about bridesmaids who have to drop out (or are kicked out) of their positions because they aren’t able to keep up with the financial toll of the countless wedding activities and accoutrements they are expected to. The idea of losing a friendship because I lost my job and didn’t want to spend all my savings on attending her bridal shower, bachelorette party, planning retreat, rehearsal dinner, destination ceremony, etc. makes my skin crawl.</p>
            <p>But it’s hard to blame the bride and groom for these high expectations. After all, this is the one chance most people have to throw a massive party for all of the people they love—of course they’d be willing to go to any lengths to make it perfect. But just how far should we expect them to go? And is a “wedding” really worth all the extra fuss? Vendors seem to think so.</p>
            <p>A Consumer Reports study found that, when quoted for two identical-sounding events, one called an anniversary party and one a wedding, 28% of vendors gave higher prices for the wedding, some by almost double. Some people believe that the higher prices are because vendors put more time and care into wedding services, such as by building in contingency plans to make sure nothing ruins the couple’s perfect day. But it’s impossible to tell if this is the case due to how unclear vendors’ pricing plans are.</p>
            <p>While some vendors are upfront about their availability and pricing, the industry standard seems to be hiding this information away behind a maze of web pages, social media accounts, and forms. The common conception of the wedding planning process is hours spent debating the precise pantone shades for the color scheme and nitpicking the placement of each flower in the bouquets, but realistically, these hours are spent filling out twenty or more forms for individual vendors to see if they are a good fit for your celebration. Most people who can afford all of the bells and whistles we consider “standard” to weddings are working full-time, but then how can they afford the time it takes to actually find these services?</p>

            <h2>The Time Sink</h2>
            <p>Take photographers for example. Say you’re looking for someone to do engagement shoots as well as cover the day-of, and you’re hoping to stay under $2,500 for these services. It already takes time scouring Instagram or the Web to find photographers in your area whose style matches your Pinterest board, but then you still have to figure out if that photographer is available for your dates and can work within your budget. The next step is to then painstakingly and repetitively fill out forms for each individual photographer, only to find out that most of them are already booked for your dates, are way out of your price range, or both. What a way to spend ten hours!</p>
            <p>Once you’ve found your photographer, couples then have to repeat this process for venues, caterers, florists, DJs, makeup artists, and whatever else their budget has room for. You’d think that given the amount these people charge for their services, they’d at least make it easy for you to give them your money! Of course, you could hire a wedding planner to do a lot of this grunt work for you, but that’s still someone you have to hunt down, vet, and pay, so many couples, especially the budget-conscious, might lie down and accept their fate as form filler-outers.</p>
            <p>This system of endless individual forms is tortuously tedious for couples, and it creates more work for vendors as well, as they have to go through all of these individual requests and respond (assuming they actually respond). I can’t imagine it’s fun for vendors to have to sort through a bunch of low-ball offers to find clients who are actually willing to pay them what they are worth either. So why does the wedding industry still operate this way?</p>
            <p>Individual vendors may have their own reasons for keeping prices private, particularly for events as unique as weddings, but the fact of the matter is that this secrecy makes it even easier for them to upcharge wedding clients. After all, most couples working without a planner are relatively inexperienced—they might have been in a wedding party or helped out with a sibling or friend’s planning, but most people only get married once. This makes it very easy to slip predatory pricing onto unassuming couples, especially when they are already stressed about making sure everything is perfect, all with an overbearing mother or friend or bank account breathing down their necks.</p>
            <p>Of course, one of the ways to keep costs low and time spent filling out forms per day to a minimum is to give yourself more time to plan. But who wants to spend YEARS of their life planning a single day? The average length of an engagement in the US is 12–18 months, which is already plenty of time (Brides.com). This timeline or longer is often necessary to nail down vendors, who can be booked over a year in advance, but it also gives more time for things to go wrong leading up to the big day. Not to mention, many couples, especially those from strong religious traditions, may not want to wait that long to go from “my fiance” to “my spouse.”</p>
            <p>In my religious community, where people get married young and fast, it is common to do a lot of the wedding yourself, and by yourself, I mean with the help of a massive network of family and friends. For one of my cousin’s weddings, my mother baked over twenty dozen cookies of different varieties to serve in place of a dinner at the reception. Another cousin chose to have a crepe bar, staffed by her aunts and cousins (including then-ten-year-old me) to feed her guests. This system seems to work fairly well, but I can’t help wondering what happens to those who don’t happen to be related to a culinary genius or have a small army of relatives willing to help out.</p>

            <h2>The Alternatives</h2>
            <p>Given the amount of time, money, and resources it takes to plan a full-scale wedding, it’s no wonder that elopements and micro-weddings are on the rise. The Knot found that weddings had an average of 118 guests, but remember that $284 per-person figure? It’s no wonder that people are increasingly questioning whether or not their estranged great-aunt Helda should really be invited or how many guests should be allowed a plus-one. Micro-weddings, typically defined as having 50 or fewer guests, can cut down on costs significantly. Elopements are often even smaller, with a select number of family and friends in attendance, or sometimes just the couple and an officiant.</p>
            <p>These small-scale alternatives to a traditional wedding party initially gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, as large gatherings were prohibited, then carefully regulated. Many couples during this time realized it wasn’t worth waiting to have a massive party to start the rest of their lives with their favorite person. Now, choosing to go small is often an economic choice. I’ve heard multiple friends and relatives describe this type of financial equation when wedding planning: the amount of money spent on the wedding should be as close to equal to (if not greater than) the amount of money brought in via gifts. I’ve never been good at math, so it makes sense to me that many people would forgo solving this word problem in favor of a more intimate, personal ceremony.</p>
            <p>But I have to wonder what might be lost by having these smaller celebrations. As previously mentioned, weddings have been treated as community celebrations for centuries, maybe even millenia. For many people, it is the only day in your life where your childhood best friend, college roommate, and favorite cousin will all be in the same room. This can not only lead to some touching moments for the bride and groom, but it could also help buck a larger social trend toward isolation and loneliness.</p>
            <p>In 2023, the US Surgeon General issued an advisory on how loneliness and isolation can impact our health as humans, noting an alarming trend away from social institutions and communities. We are increasingly trapped in solitary bubbles and get more and more of our human interaction digitally, which could be harming our mental and physical health. In times like these, bringing people together to celebrate, especially something as special as a couple’s love and future happiness, is more important than ever.</p>
            <p>In fact, weddings can be a great place to meet people without a plus one to meet each other. One study found that fifty percent of people have had a romantic encounter at someone else’s wedding, and five percent ended up marrying someone they met at a wedding (Popsugar). Even outside of romantic connections, weddings often introduce you to a variety of people you would never meet otherwise, expanding one’s social circle and increasing feelings of connectedness. Now, as an introvert, I can totally understand opting for a more intimate celebration, but time and money shouldn’t force people into going small with their weddings.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>So what are engaged couples to do? Assuming you don’t have an endless budget to spend on a wedding planner to hire top-tier vendors for you, it seems like your options are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spend a bunch of time tracking down and communicating with vendors (add in even more time if you are trying to be financially savvy in this process)</li>
                <li>Spend a bunch of time tracking down essential vendors, then even more time doing the rest yourself (with as many helpers as you can recruit)</li>
                <li>Spend a bunch of time planning events and punt as much of the cost as possible onto your wedding party, breeding resentment in your closest relationships</li>
                <li>Say screw the guest list and go small, then still spend time tracking down vendors who can do a micro-wedding</li>
                <li>Say screw the whole thing and elope, then (possibly) live to regret the party you never had</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren’t very comforting options.</p>
            <p>There’s no immediate fix to the wedding industry. For one thing, everything just costs more now. Quality vendors deserve to be fairly paid for their services just as much as couples deserve to see their dreams carried out without selling an organ on the black market. But if you don’t want to be forced into a microwedding by your budget or your schedule, or even if you just want to avoid the hassle when looking for an elopement photographer, there is a better way to find vendors.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.savewithbidi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bidi</a> is a new wedding planning marketplace that connects couples to quality vendors without the hassle of filling out endless forms. Couples simply make a request for a service on Bidi, then vendors who believe they are a good fit place bids on that couple. This simplifies the process for couples, and makes pricing clearer and more competitive. This makes it easy to find vendors who fit your vision, budget, and timeline, especially if you don’t want to wait the average year plus before tying the knot.</p>
            <p>With <a href="https://www.savewithbidi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bidi</a>, you don’t have to make wedding planning feel like a second full-time job, and you can find vendors whose prices won’t force you to actually get a second job. The best part? Bidi is completely free for couples to use, and vendors only pay if their bid is successful. Weddings can become a community celebration of unity, not just the day a couple no longer has to stress about whether or not their massive investment of time and money will pay off.</p>
