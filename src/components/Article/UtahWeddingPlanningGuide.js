            <h2>Understanding Utah's Wedding Culture</h2>

            <img src={templeWedding} alt="LDS Temple Wedding" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px', objectFit:'cover' }} />
            <p>
                Marriage in Utah holds unique significance, particularly considering the remarkable 6% divorce rate among temple-married couples, according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" className="link" href="https://www.michelleleoevents.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-wedding-in-each-season">Michelle Leo Events</a>. This statistic underscores the deep cultural and religious influences shaping Utah's wedding traditions.
            </p>

            {/* Temple Wedding Considerations Section */}
            <h3>Temple wedding considerations</h3>
            <p>
                If you are a member of the church therea are a few things yous should know. Temple weddings, typically last 30-45 minutes, as noted by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" className="link" href="https://www.michelleleoevents.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-wedding-in-each-season">wedding planning experts</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, although ring exchanges aren't officially part of temple ceremonies, you may choose to incorporate this tradition after the temple ceremony for those that couldn't attend. Many couples choose to have this ring ceremony during the reception so that most family and friends can participate in this special moment.
            </p>

            <h3>Typical wedding timeline expectations</h3>
            <p>
                A standard temple wedding timeline could look somethingl like this: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>10:00 AM - Temple sealing ceremony</p></li>
                <li><p>11:00 AM - Temple exit and photographs</p></li>
                <li><p>1:00 PM - Wedding luncheon</p></li>
                <li><p>5:00 PM - Family pictures at reception</p></li>
                <li><p>6:00 PM - Reception begins</p></li>
                <li><p>6:30 PM - Ring Ceremony (if you choose to have one)</p></li>
                <li><p>8:30 PM - Grand exit</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Thinking about your reception</h3>
            <p>
                Utah wedding receptions often follow an open-house style format, allowing guests to come and go throughout the evening. This approach accommodates larger guest lists and creates a more relaxed atmosphere and honestly, less stress for you. Trying to have an activity during every part of the reception can be overwhelming, so this is a great way to make it easier on yourself.
            </p>

            <img src={weddingTeam} alt='Wedding Team' style={{width:'100%', height:'auto', marginBottom:'20px', objectFit:'cover'}}></img>

            <h3>Best months for outdoor ceremonies</h3>
            <p>
                June through August stands as the peak season for outdoor weddings, offering mild temperatures and extended daylight hours. Still, each season brings its distinct charm:
            </p>

            <p><strong>Spring (March-May)</strong></p>

                <li><p>Scenic outdoor locations</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Fall (September-October)</strong></p>
