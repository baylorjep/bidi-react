# Testing the Stripe Onboarding Process

## Current Status
✅ Database migration applied (`google_reviews_status` column added)  
✅ Frontend error handling improved  
❌ Backend endpoints not yet deployed (`verify-account`, `delete-account`)  
✅ Existing backend endpoints working (`create-login-link`, `account`, etc.)  

## Test Steps

### 1. Test the Stripe Onboarding Flow
1. Go to your business dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Payments
3. Click "Connect" to start Stripe onboarding
4. Complete the Stripe onboarding process
5. Check if the account is properly saved to the database

### 2. Test the Business Settings Page
1. Go to business-dashboard/settings
2. Check if the page loads without errors
3. Verify that the Stripe dashboard button works
4. Check if Google reviews functionality works

### 3. Check Console Logs
Open browser developer tools and check for:
- ✅ No more `google_reviews_status` column errors
- ✅ No more 404 errors for `verify-account` and `delete-account`
- ⚠️ May still see some frame blocking errors (these are normal with Stripe)

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work Now:
- Stripe account creation
- Stripe onboarding completion
- Account ID storage in database
- Business settings page loading
- Google reviews functionality (with new column)

### ⚠️ What May Still Have Issues:
- Stripe dashboard access (until new endpoints are deployed)
- Account verification (until new endpoints are deployed)

## Backend Deployment Needed

The following endpoints need to be added to your backend:

```javascript
// Add to your backend index.js
app.post("/verify-account", async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation from backend_endpoints_to_add.md
});

app.post("/delete-account", async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation from backend_endpoints_to_add.md
});
```

## Success Criteria

The Stripe onboarding process is working if:
1. ✅ Users can create a Stripe account
2. ✅ Users can complete the onboarding flow
3. ✅ Account ID is saved to database
4. ✅ No console errors related to missing columns
5. ✅ Business settings page loads without errors

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If onboarding works**: Deploy the missing backend endpoints
2. **If onboarding fails**: Check the specific error and fix accordingly
3. **Monitor console logs**: Look for any remaining issues

## Troubleshooting

### If you see 404 errors:
- The new endpoints haven't been deployed yet
- This is expected until the backend is updated

### If you see Stripe errors:
- These are likely due to test account IDs
- Use real account IDs for testing

### If you see database errors:
- Check that the migration was applied correctly
- Verify the `google_reviews_status` column exists
